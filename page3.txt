God has smiled upon you this day
The fate of a nation in your hands
And blessed it be the children
Who fight with all our bravery
'Til only the righteous stand

You see the distant flames
They bellow in the night
You fight in all our names
For what we know is right

And when you all get shot
And cannot carry on
Though you die, La Resistance lives on

You may get stabbed in the head
With a dagger or a sword
You may be burned to death
Or skinned alive or worse

But when they torture you
You will not feel the need to run
For, though you die, La Resistance lives on

Blame Canada, blame Canada
Because the country's gone awry
Tomorrow night, these freaks will fry

Tomorrow night our lives will change
Tomorrow night we'll be entertained
An execution, what a sight, tomorrow night

Up there there is so much room
Where babies burp and flowers bloom
Tomorrow night, up there is doomed
And so I will be going soon

Shut your fucking face, Uncle Fucka
You're a boner-biting bastard, Uncle Fucka
Looks like we may be out of luck
Tomorrow night, we're pretty fucked

Why did our mothers start this war?
What-the-fuck are they fighting for?
When did this song become a marathon?
(I want to be up there)

When Canada is dead and gone
They'll be no more Celine Dion

They may cut your dick in half
And serve it to a pig
And though it hurts, you'll laugh
And you dance a dickless jig

But that's the way it goes
In war you're shat upon
Though we die, La Resistance lives on
(I want to be up there)

Blame Canada, blame Canada, blame Canada
