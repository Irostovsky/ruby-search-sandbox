Two tablespoons of cinnamon and two or three egg whites
A half a stick of butter melted
Stick it all in a bowl baby, stir it with a wooden spoon
Mix in a cup of flour, you'll be in heaven soon
Say everybody have you seen my balls
They're big and salty and brown
If you ever need a quick pick me up
Just stick my balls in your mouth
Ooh, suck on my chocolate salted balls
Stick 'em in your mouth, and suck em
Suck on my chocolate salted balls
They're packed full of vitamins and good for you
So suck on my balls

Quarter cup of unsweetened chocolate and a half a cup of brandy
Then throw in a bag or two of sugar and just a pinch of vanilla
Grease up the cookie sheet cause I hate when my balls stick
Then preheat the oven to three fifty and give that spoon a lick

Say everybody have you seen my balls
They're big and salty and brown
If you ever need a quick pick me up
Just stick my balls in your mouth
Suck on my chocolate salted balls (suck 'em now)
Put 'em in your mouth, and suck em
Suck on my chocolate salted balls
They're packed full of goodness, high in fiber
Suck on my balls

Hey, wait a minute, what's that smell
Smell like something burning
Well, that don't confront me now
Long as I get my rent paid on Friday
Baby you better get back in the kitchen
Cause I got a sneakin' suspicion
Oh man baby, baby, you just burned my balls!
Come, my balls on fire
Have mercy baby, my balls are burning
Give me some water, pour some water on me
My balls are burning, oh my goodness
I'm blowin' I'm blowin' them, do something

Ooh, suck on my chocolate salted balls (suck F 'em now)
Put 'em in your mouth and suck 'em, they're on fire baby
Suck on my chocolate salted balls (suck 'em now)
Put 'em out baby, blow 'em

Oh, suck on my balls baby, suck on my balls baby
Suck on my red hot salted chocolate balls
Come on baby, woo, woo, suck on my balls
